## 💡Project Overview 
This project is performance comparsion and performing image segmentation on Brain MRI scans. I have used 3 deep learning models U-Net, Attention U-Net and Deeplabv3. Out of which Deeplabv3 has outperformed all other models. To run the project import the project in Kaggle and click on run all. The project may face some difficulty to run other platforms. 
It requires a strong GPU to run.
Thanks for Reading.
